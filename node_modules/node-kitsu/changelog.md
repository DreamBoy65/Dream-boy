## 1.1.1 (July 1, 2018)
- Dinked around harder with getUser because I'm dumb and didn't realize that something was for clarity. (again, thanks wopian!)

## 1.1.0 (July 1, 2018)
- Created changelog.
- Dinked around with getUser so it searches by slug rather than name (thanks, wopian! Your package may be official, but mine is authentic! <3)
